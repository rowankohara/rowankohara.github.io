My research at the POP-GEM Lab focuses on examining cross-ancestry phenotypic and genetic associations with major depression and determine if interpersonal violence exposure is correlated with depression symptoms and if these associations vary by sex. This fall I will be applying to PhD programs in Bioinformatics or Human Genetics to progress my goal of becoming an academic researcher and professor."

My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n\n\nHGEN 612\nSPRING 2022\nHGEN 612 is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and fundamentals of machine learning.\n\nThis dashboard showcases the data from the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset on Kaggle. Using this data, the classification of heart disease (HeartDisease) is predicted.\n\nThis dashboard showcases the data from the Lake Tahoe Basin Jeffrey pine beetle outbreak from 2003. Using this data, the minimum linear distance to the nearest brood tree (DeadDist) is predicted."
