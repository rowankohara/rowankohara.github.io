I am proficient in R and Python, and I have a basic understanding of Java, Shell Scripting, and MySQL. I am experienced in UNIX and high-performance cluster computing environments, bioinformatics tools/databases, and wet-lab protocols.\n\n# NIH Summer Poster Day\n\n**AUGUST 2022**\n\n[NIH Summer Poster Day](https://event.fourwaves.com/spd-2022/pages) is a poster session that showcases NIH Summer Internship Program interns' research projects completed over 2 months. I participated in the [Graduate Data Science Summer Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/data_science_summer) and completed my project at the [Laboratory of Translational Genomics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/ltg) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data has more noise than long-read, which makes it difficult to genotype deletions such as the *TERT* MNS16A minisatellite. My summer project focused on computationally predicting MNS16A genotype using machine learning.\n\n![](img/ohara_NIH_poster.png){width=\"800\"}\n\n# Women's Health Research Day\n\n**APRIL 2022**\n\n[VCU's Women's Health Research Day](https://womenshealth.vcu.edu/research/womens-health-research-day/) is a poster and seminar session that promotes research efforts focusing on women's health at VCU. My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n![](img/WHRD-Ohara_2022.png){width=\"800\"}\n\n# HGEN 612\n\n**SPRING 2022**\n\n[HGEN 612](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/hgen/) is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and fundamentals of machine learning.\n\n![](img/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease.png){width=\"800\"}\n\nThis [dashboard](https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/) showcases the data from the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on Kaggle. Using this data, the classification of heart disease (`HeartDisease`) is predicted.\n\n\n<p class=\"button\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger btn-sm\" href=\"https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/\" role=\"button\">{{< fa link >}} Project</a></p>\n\n\n```{javascript}\n#| echo: false\n<input type=\"button\" onclick=\"location.href='https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/';\" value=\"shinyapps\" />\n```\n\n\n![](img/Predicting%20Beetles.png){width=\"800\"}\n\nThis [dashboard](https://rpubs.com/rowankohara/873978) showcases the data from the Lake Tahoe Basin Jeffrey pine beetle outbreak from 2003. Using this data, the minimum linear distance to the nearest brood tree (`DeadDist`) is predicted.\n\n# Undergraduate Research Symposium\n\nSPRING 2019\n\nThe [VCU Poster Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creativity](https://provost.vcu.edu/initiatives/urop/poster/) is an annual poster session giving an opportunity to undergraduate students to present their research. I presented a poster alongside my [Phage Discovery II](https://cbds.vcu.edu/2018/07/05/bnfo-252-phage-discovery-ii/) classmates on *A Comparative Study of Bacillus Phage Phireball\\'s Genomics to Other Bacillus Phage Genomes*. This project led to a Genbank submission of Bacillus phage Phireball Accession number MN038176.1 that I co-authored by annotating gene products 67-99.\n\n![](img/2019-UROP-Poster.png)\n\n",
