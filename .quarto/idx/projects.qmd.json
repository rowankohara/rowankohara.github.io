My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and symptoms of depression and alcohol use disorder among college students.\n\n![](img/WHRD2023.jpg){width=\"800\"}\n\nThis GitHub repository includes all of my code used to clean the data and create this poster.

I participated in the [Graduate Data Science Summer Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/data_science_summer) and completed my project at the [Laboratory of Translational Genomics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/ltg) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data has more noise than long-read, which makes it difficult to genotype deletions such as the *TERT* MNS16A minisatellite. My summer project focused on computationally predicting MNS16A genotype using machine learning.\n\n![](img/ohara_NIH_poster.png){width=\"800\"}\n\n<br>\n\n# HGEN 612\n\n**SPRING 2022**\n\n[HGEN 612](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/hgen/) is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and fundamentals of machine learning.\n\n![](img/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease.png){width=\"800\"}\n\nThis [dashboard](https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/) showcases the data from the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on Kaggle.
