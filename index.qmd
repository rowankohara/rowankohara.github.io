I am a first-generation college student passionate about research in biological data science. My research at the POP-GEM Lab focuses on examining cross-ancestry phenotypic and genetic associations with major depression and determining if interpersonal violence exposure is correlated with depression symptoms and if these associations vary by sex. This fall I will be applying to PhD programs in Bioinformatics or Human Genetics to progress toward my goal of becoming an academic researcher and professor.
