Hello, my name is Rowan K. O'Hara. I am a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) with Bachelors degrees in Bioinformatics and Psychology. Currently, I am a Masters student studing Bioinformatics at VCU and will graduate May 2023. This past summer I worked as an intern at the National Cancer Institute at the NIH as a part of the Graduate Data Science Summer Program. My work focused on cancer genetics and bioinformatics, particularly using machine learning to genotype the *TERT* MNS16A polymorphic minisatellite. I also work as a research associate at the POP-GEM Lab researching genetic and environmental factors that contribute to major depression.
