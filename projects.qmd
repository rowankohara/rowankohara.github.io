A common through thread all of my projects is the application of bioinformatics and data science. I am proficient in R and Python, and I have a basic understanding of Java, Shell Scripting, and MySQL. I am experienced in UNIX and high-performance cluster computing environments, bioinformatics tools/databases, and wet-lab protocols.

# NIH Summer Poster Day

**AUGUST 2022**

[NIH Summer Poster Day](https://event.fourwaves.com/spd-2022/pages) is a poster session that showcases NIH Summer Internship Program interns' research projects completed over 2 months. I participated in the [Graduate Data Science Summer Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/data_science_summer) and completed my project at the [Laboratory of Translational Genomics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/ltg) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data has more noise than long-read, which makes it difficult to genotype deletions such as the *TERT* MNS16A minisatellite. My summer project focused on computationally predicting MNS16A genotype using machine learning.

# Women's Health Research Day

**APRIL 2022**

[VCU's Women's Health Research Day](https://womenshealth.vcu.edu/research/womens-health-research-day/) is a poster and seminar session that promotes research efforts focusing on women's health at VCU. My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and depression and anxiety symptoms.

This [dashboard](https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/) showcases the data from the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on Kaggle. Using this data, the classification of heart disease (`HeartDisease`) is predicted.

# Undergraduate Research Symposium

SPRING 2019

The [VCU Poster Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creativity](https://provost.vcu.edu/initiatives/urop/poster/) is an annual poster session giving an opportunity to undergraduate students to present their research. I presented a poster alongside my [Phage Discovery II](https://cbds.vcu.edu/2018/07/05/bnfo-252-phage-discovery-ii/) classmates on *A Comparative Study of Bacillus Phage Phireball\'s Genomics to Other Bacillus Phage Genomes*. This project led to a Genbank submission of Bacillus phage Phireball Accession number MN038176.1 that I co-authored by annotating gene products 67-99.
