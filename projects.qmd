A common through thread all of my projects is the application of bioinformatics and data science. I am proficient in R and Python, and I have a basic understanding of Java, Shell Scripting, and SQL. I am experienced in UNIX and high-performance cluster computing environments, bioinformatics tools/databases, and wet-lab protocols.

# Women's Health Research Day

**APRIL 2023**

[VCU's Women's Health Research Day](https://womenshealth.vcu.edu/research/womens-health-research-day/) is a poster and seminar session that promotes research efforts focusing on women's health at VCU. My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and symptoms of depression and alcohol use disorder among college students.

# NIH Summer Poster Day

**AUGUST 2022**

[NIH Summer Poster Day](https://event.fourwaves.com/spd-2022/pages) is a poster session that showcases NIH Summer Internship Program interns' research projects completed over 2 months. I participated in the [Graduate Data Science Summer Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/data_science_summer) and completed my project at the [Laboratory of Translational Genomics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/ltg) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data has more noise than long-read, which makes it difficult to genotype deletions such as the *TERT* MNS16A minisatellite. My summer project focused on computationally predicting MNS16A genotype using machine learning.

# HGEN 612

**SPRING 2022**

[HGEN 612](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/hgen/) is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and fundamentals of machine learning.

# HGEN 611

**SPRING 2021**

[HGEN 611](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/hgen/) is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and data visualization.

![](img/internalizing_heatmap.png){width="800"}

"[Internalizing Feelings in College Students](https://osf.io/5ny9s)" is a data report characterizing data collected by Virginia Commonwealth University's [Spit for Science project](https://spit4science.vcu.edu/), which studies substance use and mental health in college students. I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the phenotypic data from the fall first year survey, specifically the depressive and anxiety scores in comparison to sex and race/ethnicity variables.

This data visualization is a part of my [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) submissions. `#TidyTuesday` is a weekly data project where the `#RStats` community share and practice their data cleaning and visualization skills. These submissions were published to both my [OSF](https://osf.io/kqaen/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RowanKOHara) accounts.

# Independent Study

**SPRING 2021**

My independent study project, supervised by Dr. [Roseann Peterson](pop-gem-lab.com), focused on cross-ancestry Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for major depression. I used [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowankohara/details/certifications/) to learn how to utilize R for data cleaning and analysis.

# Undergraduate Research Symposium

**SPRING 2019**

The [VCU Poster Symposium for Undergraduate Research and Creativity](https://provost.vcu.edu/initiatives/urop/poster/) is an annual poster session giving an opportunity to undergraduate students to present their research. I presented a poster alongside my [Phage Discovery II](https://cbds.vcu.edu/2018/07/05/bnfo-252-phage-discovery-ii/) classmates on *A Comparative Study of Bacillus Phage Phireball's Genomics to Other Bacillus Phage Genomes*. This project led to a Genbank submission of Bacillus phage Phireball Accession number MN038176.1 that I co-authored by annotating gene products 67-99.
