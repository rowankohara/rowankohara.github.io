# NIH Summer Poster Day

**AUGUST 2022**

[NIH Summer Poster Day](https://event.fourwaves.com/spd-2022/pages) is a poster session that showcases NIH Summer Internship Program interns' research projects completed over 2 months. I participated in the [Graduate Data Science Summer Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/data_science_summer) and completed my project at the [Laboratory of Translational Genomics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/ltg) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data has more noise than long-read, which makes it difficult to genotype deletions such as the *TERT* MNS16A minisatellite. My summer project focused on computationally predicting MNS16A genotype using machine learning.

# Women's Health Research Day

**APRIL 2022**

[VCU's Women's Health Research Day](https://womenshealth.vcu.edu/research/womens-health-research-day/) is a poster and seminar session that promotes research efforts focusing on women's health at VCU. My project examined sex differences in the association of interpersonal violence and depression and anxiety symptoms.

# HGEN 612

**SPRING 2022**

[HGEN 612](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/azcourses/hgen/) is a data science course offered through the human genetics department at Virginia Commonwealth University, focusing on reproducibility and fundamentals of machine learning.

This [dashboard](https://rowankohara.shinyapps.io/ohara-project2/) showcases the data from the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on Kaggle. Using this data, the classification of heart disease (`HeartDisease`) is predicted.

This [dashboard](https://rpubs.com/rowankohara/873978) showcases the data from the Lake Tahoe Basin Jeffrey pine beetle outbreak from 2003. Using this data, the minimum linear distance to the nearest brood tree (`DeadDist`) is predicted.
