I am a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) with Bachelors degrees in Bioinformatics and Psychology. Currently, I am a Masters student studing Bioinformatics at VCU and will graduate May 2023. This past summer I worked as an intern at the National Cancer Institute at the NIH as a part of the Graduate Data Science Summer Program. My work focused on cancer genetics and bioinformatics, particularly using machine learning to genotype the *TERT* MNS16A polymorphic minisatellite. I also work as a research associate at the POP-GEM Lab researching genetic and environmental factors that contribute to major depression.\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
